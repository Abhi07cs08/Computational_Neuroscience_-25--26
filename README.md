# Comp Neuro Research Project

### Overview
Baseline and experimental code for SimCLR-based contrastive learning on an ImageNet-1k subset.  
Goal: explore how representation geometry (participation ratio, spectral slope) affects forward and reverse predictability.

### Structure
- `train_simclr.py` — baseline training
- `src/` — models, dataloaders, losses
- `logs/` — training and PR metrics
- `ckpts/` — saved checkpoints
